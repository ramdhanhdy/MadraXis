## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version)
- Expo CLI

    git clone https://github.com/ramdhanhdy/MadraXis.git
    cd MadraXis
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your Supabase credentials:
    ```env
    EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="your-supabase-url"

## üìà Future Development

- **RLS Enhancement:** The current Row Level Security policies are functional but will be enhanced for greater security. The next phase involves transitioning from `user_metadata` to `app_metadata` for role checks and implementing `owner_id` fields for more granular data access control. See `database_rls.md` for more details.
- **Feature Expansion:** Adding modules for grading, parent-teacher communication, and more.
