# MadraXis

A comprehensive school management application built with React Native and Expo, designed to streamline administrative tasks, student monitoring, and communication between teachers and parents.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Role-Based Access Control:** Separate interfaces and permissions for Management, Teachers, and Parents.
- **Student & Class Management:** Tools for organizing student data, class schedules, and attendance.
- **Incident Reporting:** A system for logging and tracking student-related incidents.
- **Invite-Only Authentication:** Secure invite-only system where administrators pre-create users who then set their own passwords via email links.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React Native, Expo (v52), Expo Router
- **Backend:** Supabase (Authentication, Database, Edge Functions)
- **Styling:** Standard React Native components
- **State Management:** React Context API

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version)
- Expo CLI
- An account with Supabase

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ramdhanhdy/MadraXis.git
    cd MadraXis
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your Supabase credentials:
    ```env
    EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="your-supabase-url"
    EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your-supabase-anon-key"
    ```

4.  **Configure Supabase Authentication:**
    - In your Supabase dashboard, go to Auth ‚Üí Settings
    - Disable "Enable email sign-ups" 
    - Set reset password redirect URL to `madraxis://reset-password`
    - Pre-create users in Auth ‚Üí Users with appropriate role metadata

5.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    npx expo start
    ```
    Follow the instructions in the terminal to open the app on an emulator, simulator, or physical device via the Expo Go app.

## üîê Authentication Flow

The app uses an invite-only authentication system:

1. **User Creation**: Administrators pre-create users in Supabase Dashboard with email, role, and school_id metadata
2. **First Login**: Users request password reset to set their initial password
3. **Subsequent Logins**: Standard email + password authentication
4. **Role Routing**: Users are automatically routed to appropriate dashboards based on their role

See `docs/auth_flow.md` for detailed documentation.

## üìà Future Development

- **RLS Enhancement:** The current Row Level Security policies are functional but will be enhanced for greater security. The next phase involves transitioning from `user_metadata` to `app_metadata` for role checks and implementing `owner_id` fields for more granular data access control. See `database_rls.md` for more details.
- **Feature Expansion:** Adding modules for grading, parent-teacher communication, and more.
