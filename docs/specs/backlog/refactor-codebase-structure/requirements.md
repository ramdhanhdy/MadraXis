## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the codebase refactoring initiative. The primary goal is to transition the existing MadraXis application to a more modular, scalable, and maintainable architecture, aligning with modern development best practices.

## 2. Goals
*   Improve codebase maintainability and readability.
*   Enhance scalability to support future feature development.
*   Increase testability of components and business logic.
*   Accelerate development cycles by promoting reusability and clear separation of concerns.
*   Reduce technical debt and improve overall code quality.
*   Streamline onboarding for new developers.

## 3. User Types and Goals

### 3.1. Developer/Engineer
*   **As a Developer, I want to easily locate and understand code related to a specific feature, so that I can implement new features or fix bugs more efficiently.**
*   **As a Developer, I want a clear separation between UI, business logic, and data access, so that I can work on specific layers without impacting others.**
*   **As a Developer, I want to write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests with ease, so that I can ensure code quality and prevent regressions.**
*   **As a Developer, I want consistent patterns for UI components and feature development, so that I can contribute effectively across the codebase.**

### 3.2. Project Manager/Stakeholder
*   **As a Project Manager, I want a more predictable development process, so that I can accurately estimate timelines and manage resources.**
*   **As a Project Manager, I want higher code quality and reduced technical debt, so that the project remains sustainable long-term.**

### 3.3. QA Engineer
*   **As a QA Engineer, I want reliable and comprehensive automated tests, so that I can quickly verify functionality and identify issues.**

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1. Core Application Functionality
*   **FR1: Existing Feature Parity:** All existing features and functionalities of the MadraXis application MUST remain fully operational and behave identically after the refactor.
*   **FR2: New Feature Adherence:** All new feature development MUST strictly adhere to the new target codebase architecture and patterns.

### 4.2. UI Component Refactoring
*   **FR3: Atomic Design Implementation:** All UI components MUST be refactored and organized according to the Atomic Design principles (atoms, molecules, organisms) within the `src/ui` directory.
*   **FR4: Storybook Integration:** All refactored UI components MUST have corresponding Storybook stories for visual testing and documentation.

### 4.3. Domain Logic Refactoring
*   **FR5: Business Logic Separation:** All application business logic MUST be extracted and encapsulated within domain-specific modules under the `src/domains` directory.
*   **FR6: Data Access Layer:** Each domain module MUST contain its own API layer (`api.ts`) responsible for interacting with external services (e.g., Supabase) and encapsulating data fetching/mutation logic.
*   **FR7: Domain-Specific Hooks and Stores:** Domain modules SHOULD include domain-specific React hooks (`hooks.ts`) and global state stores (`store.ts`, e.g., using Zustand) where appropriate.

### 4.4. Routing and Navigation
*   **FR8: Expo Router Adoption:** The application's navigation MUST be migrated to utilize Expo Router, with feature-specific routes defined within the `app/` directory.

### 4.5. Feature Slicing
*   **FR9: Feature Directory Structure:** Each major application feature within the `app/` directory MUST follow the prescribed feature slice structure: `screen.tsx`, `model.ts`, `ui.tsx`, `store.ts` (optional), and dedicated tests.

### 4.6. Global State Management
*   **FR10: Centralized Contexts:** Global application contexts (e.g., `AuthContext`, `ThemeContext`) MUST be centralized under `src/context`.

### 4.7. Shared Utilities and Helpers
*   **FR11: Consolidated Libraries:** Common utilities, shared hooks, and helper functions MUST be consolidated and organized under the `src/lib` directory.

### 4.8. Global Type Declarations
*   **FR12: Centralized Types:** Global TypeScript type declarations MUST be consolidated under `src/types`.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### 5.1. Performance
*   **NFR1: Performance Baseline:** The refactored application's performance (e.g., load times, responsiveness) MUST not degrade compared to the existing version.

### 5.2. Maintainability
*   **NFR2: Code Readability:** The refactored codebase MUST be highly readable and follow consistent coding standards (e.g., ESLint, Prettier).
*   **NFR3: Modularity:** The architecture MUST promote high modularity, allowing independent development and testing of components and features.
*   **NFR4: Extensibility:** The new structure MUST be easily extensible to accommodate future features and changes without significant architectural overhauls.

### 5.3. Testability
*   **NFR5: Comprehensive Testing:** The refactored codebase MUST be covered by a comprehensive suite of unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
*   **NFR6: Test Coverage:** Aim for a minimum of 80% test coverage for new and refactored business logic.

### 5.4. Developer Experience (DX)
*   **NFR7: Clear Separation of Concerns:** The architecture MUST enforce a clear separation of concerns, making it intuitive for developers to understand where different types of logic reside.
*   **NFR8: Consistent Patterns:** Consistent architectural and coding patterns MUST be applied throughout the codebase to reduce cognitive load for developers.

### 5.5. Documentation
*   **NFR9: Architecture Documentation:** The new architecture and key design decisions MUST be clearly documented in `design.md`.
*   **NFR10: Component Documentation:** All major UI components and domain modules SHOULD have clear READMEs or inline documentation.

## 6. Prioritization (MoSCoW Method)

### 6.1. Must Have
*   FR1: Existing Feature Parity
*   FR3: Atomic Design Implementation (core atoms and molecules)
*   FR5: Business Logic Separation (core domains like `class`, `incidents`, `users`)
*   FR6: Data Access Layer
*   FR8: Expo Router Adoption
*   FR9: Feature Directory Structure (for existing features)
*   FR10: Centralized Contexts
*   FR11: Consolidated Libraries
*   FR12: Centralized Types
*   NFR1: Performance Baseline

*   NFR10: Component Documentation

### 6.4. Won't Have
*   Any new user-facing features as part of this refactoring project.
*   Major changes to the Supabase database schema (unless directly required by refactor and approved).

## 7. Migration Strategy

### 7.1. Migration Phases
The refactoring will be executed in carefully planned phases to ensure system stability and minimize disruption:

**Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup**
- Configure path aliases in `tsconfig.json`
- Set up Storybook and E2E testing frameworks
- Create migration automation scripts

**Phase 2: Parallel Structure Creation**
- Create new `src/ui/`, `src/domains/`, and `src/lib/` directories alongside existing structure
- Implement barrel exports for backward compatibility
- Set up new testing infrastructure

**Phase 3: Component Migration**
- Migrate UI components from `src/components/` to `src/ui/`
- Update component imports incrementally
- Maintain dual exports during transition

**Phase 4: Domain Migration**
- Create domain modules and migrate business logic from `src/services/`
- Update service imports to use new domain structure
- Migrate global state from stores to appropriate contexts/domains

**Phase 5: Feature Slice Migration**
- Convert flat route files to feature directory structure
- Update routing and navigation patterns
- Implement feature-specific testing

**Phase 6: Cleanup and Validation**
- Remove old directory structures
- Validate all imports and functionality
- Update documentation and deployment scripts

### 7.2. Migration Validation Requirements
*   **MR1: Import Validation:** All import statements MUST be validated after each migration phase to ensure no broken dependencies.
*   **MR2: Functionality Preservation:** All existing functionality MUST remain operational throughout the migration process.
*   **MR3: Performance Baseline:** Application performance MUST not degrade during or after migration.
*   **MR4: Rollback Capability:** Each migration phase MUST have a documented rollback procedure.
*   **MR5: Automated Testing:** All automated tests MUST pass after each migration phase.

### 7.3. Store Migration Strategy
*   **SMS1: Context Migration:** Simple global state (auth, theme) MUST be migrated to React Context providers.
*   **SMS2: Domain Stores:** Complex domain-specific state MUST use Zustand stores within domain modules.
*   **SMS3: Local State:** Feature-specific state MUST use local Zustand stores within feature directories.
*   **SMS4: Backward Compatibility:** Existing store interfaces MUST be maintained during transition period.
