# 🤝 Phase 4 → Phase 5 Handoff

**From**: Phase 4 - Domain Logic Refactoring  
**To**: Phase 5 - Feature Slice Migration  
**Date**: 2025-01-29  

## ✅ Phase 4 Completion Summary

### What Was Done
- ✅ **6 Domains Created**: class, users, incidents, subjects, dashboard, management
- ✅ **AuthStore → AuthContext**: Migrated from Zustand to React Context
- ✅ **Domain Architecture**: Repository pattern, service layer, hooks, stores, types
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Zod validation schemas throughout
- ✅ **Backward Compatibility**: All legacy exports maintained
- ✅ **Testing**: Unit tests for critical functionality

### Directory Structure Created
```
src/
├── domains/
│   ├── class/          # Complete: API, hooks, store, types, tests
│   ├── users/          # Complete: API, hooks, store, types
│   ├── incidents/      # Complete: API, hooks, store, types
│   ├── subjects/       # Complete: API, types
│   ├── dashboard/      # Complete: API, types
│   ├── management/     # Complete: API, types (renamed from schools)
│   └── index.ts
└── context/
    └── AuthContext/    # Complete: React Context replacement
```

## 🎯 Phase 5 Mission

**Goal**: Convert flat route files to feature directories following Feature-Sliced Design (FSD)

### Current Route Structure
```
app/
├── (auth)/
├── (management)/
├── (tabs)/
└── Various route files
```

### Target: Feature Slice Architecture
Organize routes into logical feature boundaries while maintaining Expo Router compatibility.

## 🛠️ Tools & Context for Next Agent

### Environment
- **React Native Expo** with TypeScript
- **Metro bundler** (not Node.js)
- **Bun** as package manager
- **Supabase** backend
- **Path aliases configured** in tsconfig.json

### Key Commands
```bash
# TypeScript check (expect @lib/@ui errors until Phase 6)
bun run tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck

# Run tests
bun run test

# Development
bun run start
```

### Expected TypeScript Errors
- `@lib/*` imports will fail (Phase 6 will fix)
- `@ui/*` imports will fail (Phase 3 already done, but some references may exist)
- This is normal and expected

## 📋 Success Criteria for Phase 5

- [ ] Routes organized into feature slices
- [ ] Navigation preserved
- [ ] Deep linking works
- [ ] Import paths updated
- [ ] Feature boundaries defined
- [ ] Create `CHECKPOINT_PHASE_5_COMPLETE.md`

## 📚 Reference Documents

- **Full Details**: `CHECKPOINT_PHASE_4_COMPLETE.md`
- **Requirements**: `requirements.md`
- **Architecture**: `design.md`
- **Task Breakdown**: `tasks.md`

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Don't worry about TypeScript errors** - they're expected until Phase 6
2. **Test navigation on device** - Use Expo Go or dev build
3. **Preserve Expo Router patterns** - Don't break existing navigation
4. **Focus on feature organization** - Group related routes logically

**Ready for Phase 5!** The domain foundation is solid. Now organize those features! 🚀
