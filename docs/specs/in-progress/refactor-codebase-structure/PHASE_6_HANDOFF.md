# Phase 6 Handoff: Complete Feature Slice Migration

**Date:** 2025-01-29  
**Status:** ðŸ”„ READY TO START  
**Story Points:** 40 SP  
**Prerequisites:** Phase 5 Complete âœ…

## Objective

Complete the migration of all remaining routes to the Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) architecture established in Phase 5, ensuring 100% consistency across the entire codebase.

## Context from Phase 5

Phase 5 successfully established the feature slice pattern and migrated 5 key features:
- Authentication (login, reset-password)
- Student dashboard
- Teacher add-students
- Parent dashboard

The pattern is proven and working with full backward compatibility maintained.

## Phase 6 Scope

### Remaining Routes to Migrate (40 SP)

#### Student Routes (12 SP)
- `app/(student)/quran-progress.tsx` â†’ `app/(student)/quran-progress/`
- `app/(student)/anti-bullying.tsx` â†’ `app/(student)/anti-bullying/`
- `app/(student)/boarding-info.tsx` â†’ `app/(student)/boarding-info/`
- `app/(student)/incident-report.tsx` â†’ `app/(student)/incident-report/`

#### Teacher Routes (16 SP)
- `app/(teacher)/dashboard.tsx` â†’ `app/(teacher)/dashboard/`
- `app/(teacher)/class/[id]/reports/` â†’ Feature slice structure
- `app/(teacher)/class/[id]/schedule/` â†’ Feature slice structure
- `app/(teacher)/class/[id]/students/` â†’ Feature slice structure
- `app/(teacher)/students/` â†’ Feature slice structure

#### Parent Routes (8 SP)
- `app/(parent)/incident-report.tsx` â†’ `app/(parent)/incident-report/`
- `app/(parent)/anti-bullying.tsx` â†’ `app/(parent)/anti-bullying/`
- `app/(parent)/cctv-request.tsx` â†’ `app/(parent)/cctv-request/`

#### Management Routes (4 SP)
- `app/(management)/dashboard.tsx` â†’ `app/(management)/dashboard/`
- `app/(management)/setup.tsx` â†’ `app/(management)/setup/`
- `app/(management)/user-management.tsx` â†’ `app/(management)/user-management/`

## Established Pattern (From Phase 5)

### Feature Slice Structure
```
feature-name/
â”œâ”€â”€ screen.tsx      # Main screen component (UI layer)
â”œâ”€â”€ model.ts        # Business logic, types, validation (Business layer)
â”œâ”€â”€ store.ts        # Local state management (optional, use Zustand)
â”œâ”€â”€ ui.tsx          # Feature-specific UI components (optional)
â””â”€â”€ index.ts        # Barrel exports for clean imports
```

### Migration Steps (Per Route)

1. **Analyze Current Route**
   - Identify business logic, state management, and UI components
   - Note any complex dependencies or integrations

2. **Create Feature Directory**
   ```bash
   mkdir app/(role)/feature-name/
   ```

3. **Extract Business Logic â†’ `model.ts`**
   ```typescript
   // Types and interfaces
   export interface FeatureState { ... }
   export interface FeatureFormData { ... }
   
   // Validation schemas (using Zod)
   export const featureFormSchema = z.object({ ... });
   
   // Business logic functions
   export const validateFeatureData = (data) => { ... };
   
   // Constants and mock data
   export const FEATURE_CONSTANTS = { ... };
   
   // Initial state
   export const initialFeatureState = { ... };
   ```

4. **Create Main Screen â†’ `screen.tsx`**
   ```typescript
   import React from 'react';
   import { Stack } from 'expo-router';
   // Import design system components
   import { ... } from '@ui/...';
   // Import feature model
   import { ... } from './model';
   
   export default function FeatureScreen() {
     // UI composition and user interaction logic
     return (
       <>
         <Stack.Screen options={{ ... }} />
         {/* UI components */}
       </>
     );
   }
   ```

5. **Add State Management â†’ `store.ts` (if needed)**
   ```typescript
   import { create } from 'zustand';
   import { devtools } from 'zustand/middleware';
   import type { FeatureState } from './model';
   
   interface FeatureStore extends FeatureState {
     // Actions
     // Computed properties
   }
   
   export const useFeatureStore = create<FeatureStore>()(
     devtools((set, get) => ({ ... }))
   );
   
   // Selector hooks
   export const useFeatureData = () => useFeatureStore(state => state.data);
   ```

6. **Create Barrel Exports â†’ `index.ts`**
   ```typescript
   // Main screen component
   export { default as FeatureScreen } from './screen';
   
   // Types and models
   export type { FeatureState, FeatureFormData } from './model';
   export { featureFormSchema, validateFeatureData, ... } from './model';
   
   // Store and hooks (if applicable)
   export { useFeatureStore, useFeatureData, ... } from './store';
   ```

7. **Update Original Route â†’ Compatibility Wrapper**
   ```typescript
   /**
    * Feature Route - Backward Compatibility Wrapper
    * 
    * This file maintains backward compatibility with the existing route structure
    * while delegating to the new feature slice implementation.
    */
   
   // Re-export the screen from the feature slice
   export { default } from './feature-name/screen';
   ```

8. **Test Backward Compatibility**
   - Verify route still works with Expo Router
   - Test navigation to/from the route
   - Ensure deep linking still functions
   - Validate no breaking changes

## Quality Standards

### Code Quality Requirements
- âœ… TypeScript strict mode compliance
- âœ… Proper error handling and validation
- âœ… Consistent naming conventions
- âœ… Comprehensive JSDoc comments
- âœ… Design system component usage

### Architecture Requirements
- âœ… Clear separation of concerns (UI, Business Logic, State)
- âœ… Proper dependency injection patterns
- âœ… Consistent file structure across all features
- âœ… Optimized performance with selector hooks

### Testing Requirements
- âœ… Backward compatibility verified
- âœ… Navigation patterns tested
- âœ… Deep linking functionality confirmed
- âœ… No breaking changes introduced

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Complete First)
1. **Student Routes** - Most frequently used by end users
2. **Teacher Routes** - Core functionality for educators
3. **Parent Routes** - Important for parent engagement
4. **Management Routes** - Administrative functions

### Dependencies and Considerations

#### Shared Components
Some routes may share components that should be extracted to shared locations:
- Anti-bullying components (used by student and parent)
- Incident reporting components (used by student and parent)
- Common dashboard patterns

#### Complex Routes
Pay special attention to:
- `app/(teacher)/class/[id]/reports/` - May have complex data fetching
- `app/(teacher)/class/[id]/students/` - May have complex state management
- `app/(management)/user-management.tsx` - May have complex permissions

## Success Criteria

### Phase 6 Complete When:
- âœ… All remaining routes migrated to feature slice structure
- âœ… 100% backward compatibility maintained
- âœ… Consistent patterns across entire codebase
- âœ… No breaking changes introduced
- âœ… All navigation and deep linking working
- âœ… Performance maintained or improved
- âœ… Code quality standards met
