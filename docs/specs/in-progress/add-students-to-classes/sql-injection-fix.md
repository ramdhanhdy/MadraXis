# SQL Injection Vulnerability Fix in ClassEnrollmentService

## Original Vulnerability
- Location: `src/services/class/enrollment.ts` (lines 274-280)
- Issue: The `searchTerm` was directly interpolated into the Supabase `.or()` query using template literals, potentially allowing SQL injection despite initial sanitization.

## Implemented Fix
- Refactored `getClassStudents` method to perform client-side filtering, sorting, and pagination when a search term is present.
- Removed the vulnerable `.or()` query construction.
- Added TypeScript fix for potential undefined `searchTerm` by introducing a local variable for type narrowing.

## Testing Instructions
- Verify the search functionality in class student listing.
- Test with various search terms, including potential injection attempts.
- Ensure no performance degradation for large student lists.

## Potential Side Effects
- Increased client-side processing for searches, monitor for performance on low-end devices.

This fix eliminates the SQL injection risk while maintaining functionality.
