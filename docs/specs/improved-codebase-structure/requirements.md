# Improved Codebase Structure Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for improving the MadraXis codebase structure to enhance maintainability, scalability, and developer experience. The improvements focus on component consolidation, legacy screen migration, testing patterns establishment, performance optimization, and feature flag implementation. These changes will build upon the existing strengths of the modular folder structure and atomic design pattern while addressing identified weaknesses in component duplication and scattered architecture.
