# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to create a consistent design system across all four user roles (management, teacher, student, parent) in the MadraXis school application. Currently, while the general color theme is consistent, the layout patterns, component structures, styling approaches, and user interface elements vary significantly between different user dashboards. This inconsistency creates a fragmented user experience and makes the application harder to maintain and scale.

The goal is to establish a unified design language that maintains role-specific functionality while ensuring visual and interaction consistency across all user interfaces.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user of any role (management, teacher, student, parent), I want the application interface to have consistent visual patterns and layouts, so that I can easily navigate and understand the interface regardless of which role I'm using.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user switches between different role dashboards THEN the header layout, navigation patterns, and basic UI structure SHALL be visually consistent
2. WHEN a user interacts with common elements like buttons, cards, and modals THEN they SHALL have identical styling and behavior across all roles
3. WHEN a user views any dashboard THEN the spacing, typography, and color usage SHALL follow the same design system rules

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the application, I want reusable UI components that can be shared across all user roles, so that I can reduce code duplication and ensure consistent styling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing new features THEN developers SHALL be able to use shared components for common UI elements
2. WHEN a design change is needed THEN it SHALL only require updates in one place to affect all user roles
3. WHEN creating new screens THEN developers SHALL have access to a standardized component library with consistent props and styling

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent navigation patterns and tab structures across all roles, so that I can intuitively understand how to move through the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any role dashboard THEN the bottom navigation SHALL have consistent styling, positioning, and interaction patterns
2. WHEN navigating between tabs THEN the active state indicators and transitions SHALL be identical across all roles
3. WHEN accessing modal dialogs or overlays THEN they SHALL have consistent header structures, close buttons, and content layouts

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent card layouts and information presentation across all roles, so that I can quickly scan and understand information regardless of the context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing information cards THEN they SHALL have consistent padding, border radius, shadow, and content structure
2. WHEN viewing lists of items THEN the spacing, dividers, and item layouts SHALL be identical across all roles
3. WHEN viewing progress indicators or status elements THEN they SHALL use the same visual patterns and color coding

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent form elements and input patterns across all roles, so that I can efficiently complete tasks without learning different interaction patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN interacting with buttons THEN they SHALL have consistent sizing, padding, typography, and hover/press states
2. WHEN using form inputs THEN they SHALL have consistent styling, validation states, and error messaging
3. WHEN viewing action buttons or quick actions THEN they SHALL follow the same grid layouts and visual hierarchy

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent loading states, error handling, and empty states across all roles, so that I have a predictable experience when dealing with different application states.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is loading THEN all roles SHALL display identical loading indicators and messaging
2. WHEN errors occur THEN error messages and retry mechanisms SHALL be consistent across all roles
3. WHEN viewing empty states THEN the placeholder content, icons, and messaging SHALL follow the same patterns

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent header structures and notification systems across all roles, so that I can easily access important information and actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any dashboard header THEN the title positioning, notification icons, and action buttons SHALL be consistently placed
2. WHEN receiving notifications THEN the notification panels SHALL have identical styling and interaction patterns
3. WHEN accessing profile or settings THEN the entry points and layouts SHALL be consistent across all roles
