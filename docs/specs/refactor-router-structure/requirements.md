# Requirements for Refactoring Expo Router Structure

## Introduction
The current routing structure has all screens defined in a single root _layout.tsx file, leading to maintenance challenges as the app scales with role-based flows. This refactoring will introduce nested layouts to improve organization, performance, and maintainability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1
**User Story:** As a developer, I want nested layouts for each user role so that I can manage role-specific routes independently without bloating the root layout.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN implementing role-specific features THEN each role SHALL have its own _layout.tsx file grouping related screens.
2. WHEN adding new screens THEN they SHALL be added to the appropriate nested layout without modifying the root.

### Requirement 2
**User Story:** As a developer, I want the root layout simplified to only handle shared routes so that it's easier to maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN viewing the root _layout.tsx THEN it SHALL only contain shared screens and route groups.
2. WHEN navigating to role-specific areas THEN the nested layouts SHALL handle the routing.

### Requirement 3
**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth performance without changes to existing navigation flows.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN using the app THEN all existing routes SHALL work as before.
2. WHEN loading role-specific sections THEN lazy-loading SHALL improve initial load times.

### Requirement 4
**User Story:** As a developer, I want compatibility and testing ensured during refactoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN refactoring THEN changes SHALL be compatible with current Expo versions.
2. WHEN complete THEN navigation for all roles SHALL be tested and verified.
