# Product Requirements Document: Class & Subject CRUD Operations

## Executive Summary

This PRD defines the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for teachers to manage their assigned classes and subjects within the MadraXis platform. The system enables teachers to add, modify, and remove class assignments while maintaining data integrity and proper authorization controls.

## Product Overview

### Purpose
Provide teachers with intuitive tools to manage their class and subject assignments, enabling them to organize their teaching responsibilities, update class information, and maintain accurate records of their teaching load.

### Target Users
- **Primary**: Classroom teachers managing multiple classes/subjects
- **Secondary**: Department heads, academic coordinators
- **Tertiary**: School administrators, substitute teachers

### Core Value Proposition
Streamline class and subject management through simple CRUD operations that reduce administrative overhead while ensuring accurate teacher-class assignments and maintaining data consistency across the platform.

## Critical User Stories

### As a teacher, I want to:
1. **Add New Classes**: "Add new classes to my teaching schedule so I can organize my curriculum and students"
2. **View My Classes**: "See all my assigned classes with details like student count, schedule, and subject information"
3. **Update Class Information**: "Modify class details such as description, schedule, or subject focus areas"
4. **Remove Classes**: "Remove classes I'm no longer teaching to keep my dashboard organized"
5. **Assign Subjects**: "Add or change subjects for each class to reflect curriculum changes"
6. **Manage Class Schedules**: "Update class meeting times and locations as needed"
7. **Bulk Operations**: "Perform multiple class operations efficiently during semester transitions"

## Detailed Requirements
