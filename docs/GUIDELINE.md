# Project Guidelines

1. When you start any task, always act like a planner.
2. Always refer to the latest documentation about any task you're working on using Context7 MCP.
3. Check to make sure the user has selected the OpenAI o3 model. If they have not, ask them to select it before going any further.
4. Always review and follow all rules in .cursor/rules (or .windsurfrules)
5. Always refer to the http://README.md file in the root of the project when you want to run any command.
5. Make sure you refer docs/scratchpad.md for lessons learned.
6. Ask any questions that's not clear to you and make sure you understand the task before you start.
