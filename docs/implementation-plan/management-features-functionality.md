# Implementation Plan for Management Features Functionality

## Background and Motivation
The goal of this task is to transform the existing mockups for the management role into fully functional features. Currently, the displays under the management role are placeholders and lack real functionality. This task aims to implement the backend logic, database interactions, and UI integrations necessary to make these features operational.

**Date Initiated**: 10 July 2025

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- **Understanding Existing Mockups**: The current mockups in `app/management/` need to be analyzed to identify the intended functionality for each feature.
- **Database Integration**: Ensuring that the management features interact correctly with the database, including CRUD operations for relevant entities.
- **User Authentication and Authorization**: Management features must be accessible only to authorized users with the correct role.
- **UI/UX Integration**: The functional backend must be seamlessly integrated with the existing UI components to provide a cohesive user experience.
- **Testing and Validation**: Each feature needs to be thoroughly tested to ensure it meets the intended functionality and handles edge cases appropriately.

    - **Success Criteria**: PR approved, merged, and branch deleted.

## Feature Analysis
Based on the review of the files in `app/management/`, the following functionalities are intended for each mockup:

- **Dashboard (`dashboard.tsx`)**: This serves as the main dashboard for the management role. It currently renders the `ManagementDashboard` component from `../screens/management/ManagementDashboard`. The intended functionality is to display key metrics, statistics, or summaries relevant to school management, such as student enrollment numbers, teacher performance, or incident reports. It should provide an overview of the school's operational status.
  - **Specifications**:
    - **Inputs**: User authentication data to verify management role; school ID to fetch relevant data.
    - **Outputs**: Visual representation of data including charts, tables, or cards showing:
      - **Student Enrollment Trends**: Number of students enrolled over a period to track growth or decline.
      - **Teacher-to-Student Ratio**: Current ratio to assess staffing adequacy.
      - **Incident Reports Summary**: Count or trend of recent incidents (e.g., bullying, disciplinary issues) by type or status.
      - **Academic Performance Overview**: Average scores or pass rates across key subjects or assessments.
      - **Teacher Performance Metrics**: Summary of performance scores based on observations or punctuality.
      - **Budget Utilization or Financial Health**: High-level view of expenditure (if applicable).
      - **Parent Communication or Feedback**: Number of parent-teacher meetings or response rates to communications.
      - **Kehadiran Siswa (Student Attendance)**: Retained as a useful metric for student engagement.
    - **Interactions**: Users can view data summaries; potential future interactions could include filtering data by date range or category, and clicking on specific data points to view detailed reports.

- **Setup (`setup.tsx`)**: This feature is designed for initial school setup and configuration by management users. It includes a form to input school details such as name, NPSN (Nomor Pokok Sekolah Nasional), and the manager's name. The functionality involves creating a new school record in the database, updating the user's metadata with the school ID and full name, and refreshing the session to reflect these changes. It also includes a debug feature to check JWT claims, indicating a focus on ensuring correct user authentication and authorization.
  - **Specifications**:
    - **Inputs**: School name (text), NPSN (numeric text), Manager's full name (text).
    - **Outputs**: Confirmation message on successful setup; error message if setup fails.
    - **Interactions**: Users input data into form fields, submit the form to create a school record and update user metadata; debug feature to check JWT claims for troubleshooting authentication issues.

- **Index (`index.tsx`)**: This file acts as an entry point for the management section, redirecting users to the dashboard. Its purpose is to ensure that accessing the management section automatically navigates to the dashboard for a seamless user experience.
  - **Specifications**:
    - **Inputs**: None.
    - **Outputs**: Automatic redirection to the dashboard page.
    - **Interactions**: No direct user interaction; redirection happens automatically upon accessing the management section.
