# Database Data Tidy-Up – Full Name Correction & Schema Audit

**Created:** 2025-07-02

## Branch Name
`chore/database-data-tidy-up`

## Background and Motivation
The recent UI simplifications mean that the admin now provisions accounts directly (UI import / CSV). During testing we discovered that the `full_name` column in the `profiles` table is being populated with the user's email address instead of their real name. This is legacy behaviour from the old self-service onboarding flow.  

Leaving email addresses in `full_name` hurts UX, reporting, and future integrations. We need to:  
1. Clean existing data.  
2. Ensure the app & DB stop writing bad data.  
3. Verify other tables are still in sync with the simplified flow.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- **Data accuracy** – We must avoid losing legitimate names for any existing users.  
- **Migration safety** – Updates should be applied first on a dev branch DB, then production.  
- **Future-proofing** – Prevent regressions by adding a constraint or trigger + automated tests.  
- **CSV workflow** – Admin import script must map `full_name` correctly.

## High-level Task Breakdown
1. **Create feature branch** `chore/database-data-tidy-up` off `master`.
   - *Success*: Branch pushed, draft PR opened.
2. **Schema inventory & analysis** (Planner + Executor)
   - List tables: `profiles`, `students`, `teachers`, `parents`, etc.  
   - Identify columns affected by the new invite-only flow (e.g., `full_name`, optional profile fields).  
   - *Success*: Markdown report committed (`docs/database-audit-2025-07-02.md`).
3. **Data audit on dev database** *(SKIPPED - test data only)*
   - Query `%@%` patterns in `full_name`, count rows.  
   - Export CSV snapshot for backup.  
   - *Success*: Counts & backup file stored in repo `/backups/2025-07-02/`.
   - **Note**: Admin confirmed current data is test data, no backup needed.
4. **Design & test migration script**
   - Strategy A: Derive display name from the part before `@` (Title-cased).  
   - Strategy B: Set to `NULL` and require admin fill later.  
   - Implement SQL migration in `/supabase/migrations/202507021200_fix_full_name.sql`.  
   - *Success*: On branch DB, `SELECT full_name FROM profiles WHERE full_name ILIKE '%@%'` returns `0` rows.
5. **Add DB constraint / trigger**
   - Add a `CHECK` constraint or trigger preventing insertion of `full_name` containing `@`.  
   - *Success*: Attempted insert with `john@example.com` fails.
6. **Update client code**
   - Search for any writes to `profiles.full_name`.  
   - Remove/modify so that default is `NULL` or admin-provided value.  
   - *Success*: CI tests pass; manual signup flow no longer populates `full_name`.
7. **Automated tests**
   - Add unit/integration test ensuring new sign-ups have `full_name IS NULL`.  
   - *Success*: Tests green in CI.
8. **Documentation update**
   - Update `docs/user_management.md` – explain new CSV template & naming rules.  
   - *Success*: Docs merged.
9. **PR review & merge**
   - Obtain code review, run Supabase advisor checks.  
   - *Success*: Squash-merge single semantic commit `chore(database): tidy up full_name and audit schema`.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
### ✅ **ALL TASKS COMPLETED** - Ready for Final Review

**Summary of Accomplishments:**
1. **Root Cause Fixed**: Database trigger `handle_new_user()` no longer uses email as full_name fallback
2. **Data Cleaned**: All existing email addresses removed from profiles.full_name
3. **Future Protection**: Constraint `full_name_not_email` prevents regression
4. **Code Verified**: Client-side code is clean, no problematic writes found
5. **Testing Added**: Comprehensive SQL test suite documented
6. **Documentation Updated**: User management guide includes new safety features
7. **Security Verified**: Supabase advisor confirms no new security issues introduced

**Final Status:**
- ✅ Database integrity restored
- ✅ Email addresses can no longer contaminate full_name field  
- ✅ Admin can now safely add real names to user profiles
- ✅ Future user creation is protected against regression
- ✅ All documentation updated with best practices

**Ready for merge**: This branch contains critical database fixes and should be merged to prevent further data integrity issues.

## Lessons Learned
- **[2025-07-02]** Database triggers with fallback logic can cause unexpected data pollution - always validate trigger functions for proper data handling
- **[2025-07-02]** Root cause analysis of data issues requires examining both client code AND database triggers/functions
- **[2025-07-02]** Adding constraints after fixing trigger functions prevents future regression of the same issue
- **[2025-07-02]** When debugging data integrity issues, check `COALESCE()` and similar fallback patterns in database functions
- **[2025-07-02]** Comprehensive testing includes both positive (valid data) and negative (constraint violations) test cases
