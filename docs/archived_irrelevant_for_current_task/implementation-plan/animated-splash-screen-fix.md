# AnimatedSplashScreen Infinite Animation Fix

## Background and Motivation

**Issue Description**: The `AnimatedSplashScreen` component has a critical bug where the splash screen animation restarts infinitely instead of playing once. 

**Root Cause**: The `useEffect` in `AnimatedSplashScreen` includes `onAnimationFinish` in its dependency array. Since the `handleAnimationFinish` callback in the parent component (`app/_layout.tsx`) is recreated on every render, this causes the `useEffect` to run repeatedly, restarting the animation.

**Impact**: 
- Poor user experience with continuously restarting splash animation
- Potential performance issues from repeated animation starts
- Prevents normal app initialization flow

**Current State**: The bug is present in the current codebase and needs immediate fix.

## Branch Name
`fix/animated-splash-screen-infinite-restart`

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Technical Analysis
1. **Dependency Array Issue**: The `useEffect` in `AnimatedSplashScreen.tsx` line 26 includes `onAnimationFinish` in its dependency array: `[scale, onAnimationFinish]`
2. **Parent Component Render Cycle**: Every time `RootLayoutNav` re-renders, the `handleAnimationFinish` function is recreated as a new reference
3. **React Hook Dependency Logic**: React detects the callback as "changed" and re-runs the effect, causing animation restart

### Root Cause Analysis
- **File**: `app/components/AnimatedSplashScreen.tsx`
- **Line**: 26 - `}, [scale, onAnimationFinish]`
- **Problem**: Including `onAnimationFinish` in dependency array
- **Parent Impact**: `handleAnimationFinish` in `app/_layout.tsx` is not memoized

### Solution Options
1. **Option A (Recommended)**: Remove `onAnimationFinish` from dependency array - animation should only run once
2. **Option B**: Wrap `handleAnimationFinish` in `useCallback` in parent component
3. **Option C**: Use `useRef` to persist the callback reference

**Final Action**: Successfully committed and pushed to `refactor/svg-component-and-metro-fix` branch
**Actual Time**: ~45 minutes (faster than estimated)

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

### [2025-01-13] Implementation Complete
- âœ… **Fix Applied**: Successfully removed `onAnimationFinish` from useEffect dependency array
- âœ… **Testing**: User confirmed splash screen animation now plays only once without infinite restart
- âœ… **Code Quality**: Added explanatory comment for future reference

### Technical Implementation Notes
- **File Modified**: `app/components/AnimatedSplashScreen.tsx`
- **Line Changed**: Line 26 - dependency array `[scale, onAnimationFinish]` â†’ `[scale]`
- **Comment Added**: "Removed onAnimationFinish to prevent infinite restart"
- **Functionality Preserved**: `onAnimationFinish` callback still executes correctly

## Technical Implementation Details

### Primary Fix Implementation
**File**: `app/components/AnimatedSplashScreen.tsx`
**Line**: 26
**Current Code**: `}, [scale, onAnimationFinish]);`
**Fixed Code**: `}, [scale]);`

### Rationale for Fix
- Splash screen animation should only run once on component mount
- The callback `onAnimationFinish` is not expected to change in a way that should restart the animation
- Removing it from dependencies prevents infinite restart while preserving functionality

### Alternative Solutions Considered
1. **useCallback in Parent**: Would work but adds unnecessary complexity
2. **useRef for Callback**: Overcomplicated for this use case
3. **Primary Solution**: Simple, clean, and addresses root cause directly

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing
1. Start app and observe splash screen behavior
2. Verify animation plays once without restart
3. Confirm app navigates normally after animation
4. Test on different devices/orientations

### Automated Testing
- Consider adding unit tests for animation lifecycle
- Test callback execution timing

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Animation plays exactly once on app startup
- [ ] No infinite restart behavior observed
- [ ] Callback `onAnimationFinish` executes properly
- [ ] App continues normal flow after animation
- [ ] Code is documented and reviewed
- [ ] Pull request merged successfully

## Lessons Learned

### [2025-01-13] React useEffect Dependency Array Best Practices
- **Issue**: Including callbacks in useEffect dependencies can cause infinite loops when parent re-renders
- **Solution**: Only include dependencies that should trigger effect re-runs
- **Best Practice**: For one-time animations, avoid including callback functions in dependency arrays
- **Key Insight**: Splash screen animations should typically run only once on component mount

### [2025-01-13] Debugging Animation Issues
- **Symptom**: Infinite restart of splash screen animation
- **Root Cause**: useEffect dependency array including recreated callback function
- **Detection**: Look for callbacks from parent components in useEffect dependencies
- **Fix**: Remove callback from dependencies when effect should run only once
