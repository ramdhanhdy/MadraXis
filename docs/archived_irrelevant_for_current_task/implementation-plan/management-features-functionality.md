# Implementation Plan for Management Features Functionality

## Background and Motivation
The goal of this task is to transform the existing mockups for the management role into fully functional features. Currently, the displays under the management role are placeholders and lack real functionality. This task aims to implement the backend logic, database interactions, and UI integrations necessary to make these features operational.

**Date Initiated**: 10 July 2025

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- **Understanding Existing Mockups**: The current mockups in `app/management/` need to be analyzed to identify the intended functionality for each feature.
- **Database Integration**: Ensuring that the management features interact correctly with the database, including CRUD operations for relevant entities.
- **User Authentication and Authorization**: Management features must be accessible only to authorized users with the correct role.
- **UI/UX Integration**: The functional backend must be seamlessly integrated with the existing UI components to provide a cohesive user experience.
- **Testing and Validation**: Each feature needs to be thoroughly tested to ensure it meets the intended functionality and handles edge cases appropriately.

## Feature Analysis
Based on the review of the files in `app/management/`, the following functionalities are intended for each mockup:

- **Dashboard (`dashboard.tsx`)**: This serves as the main dashboard for the management role. It currently renders the `ManagementDashboard` component from `../screens/management/ManagementDashboard`. The intended functionality is to display key metrics, statistics, or summaries relevant to school management, such as student enrollment numbers, teacher performance, or incident reports. It should provide an overview of the school's operational status.
  - **Specifications**:
    - **Inputs**: User authentication data to verify management role; school ID to fetch relevant data.
    - **Outputs**: Visual representation of data including charts, tables, or cards showing:
      - **Student Enrollment Trends**: Number of students enrolled over a period to track growth or decline.
      - **Teacher-to-Student Ratio**: Current ratio to assess staffing adequacy.
      - **Incident Reports Summary**: Count or trend of recent incidents (e.g., bullying, disciplinary issues) by type or status.
      - **Academic Performance Overview**: Average scores or pass rates across key subjects or assessments.
      - **Teacher Performance Metrics**: Summary of performance scores based on observations or punctuality.
      - **Budget Utilization or Financial Health**: High-level view of expenditure (if applicable).
      - **Parent Communication or Feedback**: Number of parent-teacher meetings or response rates to communications.
      - **Kehadiran Siswa (Student Attendance)**: Retained as a useful metric for student engagement.
    - **Interactions**: Users can view data summaries; potential future interactions could include filtering data by date range or category, and clicking on specific data points to view detailed reports.

- **Setup (`setup.tsx`)**: This feature is designed for initial school setup and configuration by management users. It includes a form to input school details such as name, NPSN (Nomor Pokok Sekolah Nasional), and the manager's name. The functionality involves creating a new school record in the database, updating the user's metadata with the school ID and full name, and refreshing the session to reflect these changes. It also includes a debug feature to check JWT claims, indicating a focus on ensuring correct user authentication and authorization.
  - **Specifications**:
    - **Inputs**: School name (text), NPSN (numeric text), Manager's full name (text).
    - **Outputs**: Confirmation message on successful setup; error message if setup fails.
    - **Interactions**: Users input data into form fields, submit the form to create a school record and update user metadata; debug feature to check JWT claims for troubleshooting authentication issues.

- **Index (`index.tsx`)**: This file acts as an entry point for the management section, redirecting users to the dashboard. Its purpose is to ensure that accessing the management section automatically navigates to the dashboard for a seamless user experience.
  - **Specifications**:
    - **Inputs**: None.
    - **Outputs**: Automatic redirection to the dashboard page.
    - **Interactions**: No direct user interaction; redirection happens automatically upon accessing the management section.

## Testing Plan and Results
**Test Plan for Management Features Functionality**

**Date**: 10 July 2025

**Objective**: Verify that the implemented management features (dashboard, setup, and RBAC) function as expected.

**Test Scenarios**:
1. **Management Dashboard Metrics Display**
   - **Objective**: Ensure the dashboard displays correct metrics fetched from the backend.
   - **Steps**:
     - Log in as a management user with an associated school ID.
     - Navigate to the management dashboard.
     - Verify that metrics (Student Enrollment, Teacher Count, Teacher-to-Student Ratio, Incident Summary, Academic Performance, Student Attendance, Teacher Performance, and Parent Engagement) are displayed and reflect plausible data based on the database.
   - **Expected Result**: All metrics are displayed correctly with data matching the backend records.
   - **Actual Result**: [To be filled after testing]

2. **School Setup Functionality**
   - **Objective**: Ensure the setup feature allows creating or updating school information.
   - **Steps**:
     - Log in as a management user without an associated school ID (or simulate a new setup).
     - Navigate to the setup screen.
     - Enter valid school details (Name, NPSN, etc.) and submit.
     - Verify that the school data is saved and the user is redirected appropriately.
   - **Expected Result**: School data is saved successfully, and the user is redirected to the dashboard.
   - **Actual Result**: [To be filled after testing]

3. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - **Objective**: Ensure only management users can access management features.
   - **Steps**:
     - Attempt to access management routes (/management/dashboard, /management/setup) as a non-management user (teacher, parent, student).
     - Verify that non-management users are redirected to their respective dashboards or the login screen.
     - Log in as a management user and verify access to management routes.
   - **Expected Result**: Non-management users are redirected, and management users can access the routes.
   - **Actual Result**: [To be filled after testing]

**Testing Status**: Awaiting manual testing by the user or development team. Please follow the steps outlined above and update the 'Actual Result' fields with the outcomes.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
**Date**: 10 July 2025

**Issue Identified**: Backend-UI connection showing "N/A" values for all metrics.

**Root Cause**: The dashboard service had several critical issues:
1. Syntax error in the import statement (`aimport` instead of `import`)
2. Incorrect database queries - `student_performance` and `teacher_performance` tables do not have `school_id` fields, they need to be joined through the `profiles` table.

**Resolution**: 
- Fixed the import syntax error
- Updated database queries to properly join with `profiles` table using `profiles!inner(school_id)` syntax
- Added better error handling and logging to the dashboard component
- Improved loading states and error display in the UI

**Status**: Issue resolved and committed. Backend and UI should now be properly connected.

**New Feature Added**: User Management Screen

**Date**: 10 July 2025

**Feature**: Created a comprehensive user management screen (`app/management/user-management.tsx`) that allows management users to:
- View and manage students and teachers in their school
- Search through users by name
- Switch between student and teacher tabs with count indicators
- Navigate to user details (placeholder functionality)
- Add new users (placeholder modal for future implementation)

**Integration**: 
- Connected the "Manajemen Pengguna" button in the dashboard's "Aksi Cepat" section to navigate to `/management/user-management`
- Uses existing user services (`fetchStudents`, `fetchTeachers`) for data retrieval
- Follows the same design patterns and authentication logic as other management screens

**Features Include**:
- Responsive design with proper loading states and error handling
- Search functionality for filtering users
- Tab-based navigation between students and teachers
- Proper RBAC integration (uses school_id from authenticated user)
- Empty states for when no users are found
- Back navigation to return to dashboard

**Bug Fix**: School ID Access Issue

**Date**: 10 July 2025

**Issue**: User management screen showed "School ID not found for this user" error even when school_id existed in the database.

**Root Cause**: The user management screen was only checking `user.user_metadata?.school_id` but not using `profile.school_id` as a fallback. The AuthContext loads user profile data from the `profiles` table, and the school_id might be stored there instead of in the auth user metadata.

**Resolution**: 
- Updated user management screen to use the same pattern as other working screens: `user.user_metadata?.school_id || profile?.school_id`
- Added `profile` to the useAuth hook destructuring
- Updated useEffect dependencies to include `profile` so data re-fetches when profile loads
- Added debug logging to help troubleshoot similar issues in the future

**Status**: Fixed and committed. User management screen should now properly access school_id from either source.
