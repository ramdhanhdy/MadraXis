# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The SubjectManager component has been developed but is not yet accessible through the teacher's class detail page navigation. This feature will integrate the existing SubjectManager component into the class detail page by adding a new "Mata Pelajaran" (Subjects) tab alongside the existing Overview, Students, and Schedule tabs. This integration will allow teachers to manage class subjects directly from the class detail view, providing a seamless workflow for subject administration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want to access subject management from the class detail page, so that I can manage all class-related information in one centralized location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to a class detail page THEN I SHALL see a "Mata Pelajaran" tab alongside existing tabs (Overview, Students, Schedule)
2. WHEN I click on the "Mata Pelajaran" tab THEN the system SHALL display the SubjectManager component for that specific class
3. WHEN I switch between tabs THEN the active tab SHALL be visually highlighted and the content SHALL update accordingly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want the subject management interface to be consistent with the existing class detail design, so that the user experience remains cohesive and intuitive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the "Mata Pelajaran" tab is displayed THEN it SHALL follow the same visual design patterns as other tabs
2. WHEN the SubjectManager component is rendered THEN it SHALL integrate seamlessly within the existing tab content area
3. WHEN I interact with the subject management features THEN the interface SHALL maintain the same styling and behavior patterns as other class detail sections

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want the subject count to be reflected in the tab label, so that I can quickly see how many subjects are assigned to the class.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN subjects are loaded for a class THEN the "Mata Pelajaran" tab SHALL display the count of subjects in the format "Mata Pelajaran (X)"
2. WHEN I add or remove subjects THEN the tab label count SHALL update automatically in real-time
3. WHEN there are no subjects THEN the tab SHALL display "Mata Pelajaran (0)"

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want the subject management functionality to work independently of other tabs, so that I can manage subjects without affecting other class information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I perform subject management actions (add, edit, delete) THEN these actions SHALL only affect the subjects tab content
2. WHEN I switch away from the subjects tab and return THEN the subjects data SHALL remain current and accurate
3. WHEN subject operations complete THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate feedback without disrupting other tab functionality
