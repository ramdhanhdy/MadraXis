  - Write unit tests for unused file detection
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4_

- [ ] 5. Implement package dependency analyzer
  - Create parser for package.json dependencies (prod, dev, peer)
  - Cross-reference package imports with actual usage in source code
  - Handle indirect usage through configuration files and build tools
  - Account for React Native/Expo SDK implicit dependencies
  - Write tests for dependency usage analysis
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [ ] 6. Build dead code and unused export detector
  - Implement analysis for exported functions/classes that are never imported
  - Add detection for unreachable code blocks and unused variables
  - Handle TypeScript-specific exports (types, interfaces)
  - Create logic for identifying internal-only exports that can be made private
  - Write unit tests for dead code detection
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 7. Create safety validation system
  - Implement test runner integration to validate removals
  - Add build process validation after cleanup operations
  - Create rollback mechanism using git or file system backups
  - Implement change tracking and logging system
  - Write tests for safety validation and rollback functionality
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.4_

- [ ] 8. Implement safe removal operations
  - Create file removal utilities with proper error handling
  - Implement package.json dependency removal with lock file updates
  - Add code modification utilities for removing unused exports
  - Integrate safety checks before and after each removal operation
  - Write integration tests for removal operations
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 9. Build cleanup report generator
  - Implement comprehensive reporting system for all cleanup operations
  - Create categorized summaries of removed items by type
  - Add detailed logging of changes made and items flagged for review
  - Generate statistics on files removed, dependencies cleaned, and code reduced
  - Write tests for report generation and formatting
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [ ] 10. Create main cleanup orchestrator
  - Implement main cleanup function that coordinates all analysis and removal steps
  - Add configuration loading and validation
  - Integrate all analyzer modules with proper error handling
  - Create progress reporting for long-running operations
  - Write end-to-end integration tests for complete cleanup workflow
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1_

- [ ] 11. Add CLI interface and configuration
  - Create command-line interface for running cleanup operations
  - Implement configuration file support for customizing cleanup behavior
  - Add dry-run mode for previewing changes without making them
  - Create interactive mode for reviewing flagged items
  - Write tests for CLI functionality and configuration handling
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.3, 4.4, 5.4_

- [ ] 12. Integrate with project build and test systems
  - Add npm script for running codebase cleanup
  - Integrate with existing Jest test configuration
  - Ensure compatibility with Expo/React Native build process
  - Add pre-commit hooks or CI integration options
  - Test integration with project's existing toolchain
  - _Requirements: 4.2, 4.3_
