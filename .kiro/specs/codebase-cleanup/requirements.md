# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on systematically cleaning up the codebase by identifying and safely removing unused files, dependencies, and code. The goal is to reduce technical debt, improve maintainability, and optimize the project structure while ensuring no breaking changes are introduced.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify unused files in the codebase, so that I can reduce clutter and improve project maintainability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the project structure THEN the system SHALL identify files that are not imported or referenced by any other files
2. WHEN scanning for unused files THEN the system SHALL exclude configuration files, assets, and documentation from removal consideration
3. WHEN identifying unused files THEN the system SHALL provide a comprehensive list with file paths and reasons for being considered unused
4. IF a file is only used in tests or stories THEN the system SHALL flag it as potentially unused but require manual review

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify unused dependencies in package.json, so that I can reduce bundle size and security vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing package.json THEN the system SHALL identify dependencies that are not imported in any source files
2. WHEN checking dependencies THEN the system SHALL distinguish between production dependencies, dev dependencies, and peer dependencies
3. WHEN identifying unused dependencies THEN the system SHALL account for indirect usage through configuration files and build tools
4. IF a dependency is used only in configuration files THEN the system SHALL flag it for manual review rather than automatic removal

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify unused exports and dead code, so that I can clean up internal APIs and reduce complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing TypeScript/JavaScript files THEN the system SHALL identify exported functions, classes, and variables that are never imported
2. WHEN checking for dead code THEN the system SHALL identify unreachable code blocks and unused variables
3. WHEN scanning exports THEN the system SHALL account for barrel exports (index.ts files) and re-exports
4. IF an export is only used in the same file THEN the system SHALL suggest making it private or removing it

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to safely remove identified unused code, so that I can clean up the codebase without breaking functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN removing unused files THEN the system SHALL create a backup or use version control to enable rollback
2. WHEN removing code THEN the system SHALL run tests after each removal to ensure no functionality is broken
3. WHEN cleaning up dependencies THEN the system SHALL remove them from package.json and update lock files
4. IF removal causes test failures THEN the system SHALL revert the change and flag the item for manual review

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to generate a cleanup report, so that I can review what was removed and make informed decisions about edge cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a detailed report of all changes made
2. WHEN generating the report THEN the system SHALL include file paths, dependency names, and reasons for removal
3. WHEN reporting THEN the system SHALL categorize removals by type (files, dependencies, exports, dead code)
4. IF manual review is required THEN the system SHALL clearly list items that need developer attention
